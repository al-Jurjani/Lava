# Lava: Introduction to Programming Coursework

This repository is an archive of the work I completed for my "Introduction to Programming" course. As one of my earliest experiences with programming, it represents my journey in learning the fundamentals of software development.

The repository contains a mix of weekly lab exercises, practice code I wrote at home, and two larger final projects.

## Highlighted Projects

While the repository contains various smaller exercises, there are two major projects that I'm particularly proud of:

### 1. Connect-4 Game

A fully playable, two-player Connect-4 game that runs entirely in the command line. It features:
- A dynamic game board that updates after each move.
- Input validation to ensure players choose valid columns.
- Logic to detect a win (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw.

### 2. Sudoku Solver

A program that can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It's capable of:
- Reading a puzzle from a text file or user input.
- Recursively exploring possible solutions.
- Finding and displaying the completed puzzle grid.

## Core Concepts Covered

This coursework provided a solid foundation in many core programming concepts, including:

- **Language Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, loops, conditional statements, and functions.
- **Data Structures:** Working with arrays, vectors, and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Algorithm Design:** Implementing logic for games and solving puzzles with algorithms like backtracking.
- **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files.
- **Basic Program Structure:** Organizing code into logical, maintainable components.

## How to Use

The code in this repository is written in **Java**. To compile and run one of the projects, you will need a corresponding compiler or runtime environment.
